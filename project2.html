      <!--02. OVERVIEW-->
      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>Astrology is a very popular subject, especially among Millennials and
          Generation Z, many of whom use it to determine relationship
          compatibility. However, despite the popularity of dating apps, there
          are no dating apps that include astrology in it as a key component.
          Thus, my StarCrossed app is meant to unify astrology and dating into a
          singular app. Users can use this app to not only understand astrology
          and keep up with horoscopes, but connect with people based on
          astrological and personal compatibility.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!--03. PROBLEM-->
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>While there are many astrology apps and dating apps available, many
          users are dissatisfied with both. For astrology apps, most users feel
          that they do not understand enough about astrology to understand how
          to apply it to their lives. For dating apps, many users, particularly
          women, do not feel comfortable using them because of online harassment
          and concerns with safety. As such, StarCrossed aims to not only merge
          the two subjects into a single app, but to provide a positive
          experience for everyone who wants to use it.
        </p>

          <p>When I wrote the survey, I wanted there to be space such that in
            the event that there was not a market for astrology dating apps, I
            could use the information to go into a different direction with this
            project. The results I got from the people who completed the survey
            went as follows:

          </div>
          <p>From the responses, it is clear that there is a market for this
            kind of app among astrology users, especially if they use it to
            figure out aspects of their individual personality. It is also
            important to note that for respondants who are not connected with
            astrology,
            <span class="underline_green"><strong>81.8% of people</span>
            are open to using an astrology app
            provided that it explains to them what different astrology terms
            mean, as well as the purpose of the different signs within their
            natal chart</strong>. This is determined by one's location and time of birth,
            and is meant to explain the intricacies of one's personality. This
            is to say that if the app provides educational material about how
            astrology works, it may garner interest from people who are both
            passingly familiar with astrology and already invested in astrology.

          Regina likes to dabble in astrology. She finds it useful to know the
          signs and their traits, which helps her be observant to other people's
          personal characteristics. This translates to her interest in using
          astrology for dating, in that she believes being observant in this
          manner towards her potential partners can help her improve her dating
          life. Regina's interest in using a dating app that incorporates
          astrology is also based on sign compatibility, as well as the hopes
          that she can understand who has had success with dating people who
          share her sign. As a lifelong romantic, Regina is also open to a
          dating app that will help her find someone meaningful to share a
          connection with, and believes astrology has the potential to help
          realize her romantic dreams.

          connect with other people within the community through learning about
          their signs. They like the idea of having an app that encompasses both
          of these things, and would like to try using it to find people through
          the app. While they do not believe in astrology per se, they find it
          helpful to use it to contextualize parts of their personality, to both
          self actualize and understand aspects of other people's interiority to
          determine compatibility.

          colors to represent the night sky.

        <p>I incorporated the color scheme into my style guide and my logo,
          using dark blue colors. For font choice, I went with Inconsolata and
          Special Elite because of how they resemble typewriting fonts. I chose
          them because it conveyed an old-fashioned vibe that complemented the
          longevity of astrology.

        <p>One of the first changes I made was for a user who had large fingers,
          and has trouble using small buttons. I increased the size of the
          buttons that are meant to approve or reject potential matches to suit
          their needs. The larger buttons I ultimately chose to use are at the

      <div class="p-container">
        <p class= "p-space">I also made minor design changes in areas such as the new user
          questionnaire section, in which I changed the "other" designation in
          gender to "custom" to be more inclusive towards gender non-conforming
          people. I am still not very satisfied with this method of gender
          categorization, and it is something to look into if I were to do
          future iterations of this project. I also changed the radial buttons,
          which generally is used to select a single option, to a checkbox to
          indicate users can choose more than one option. The final design
          choice is on the

        <p class= "p-space">Moreover, as I started to incorporate the branding into the prototype,
          I found that some users had trouble with the design choices I made.
          For instance, I used a glowing effect to mimic that of stars in the
          night sky to stand out against the dark colors. However, some users
          had trouble visually processing this app, as it produced a blurring
          effect for them that makes it difficult to read. In deference to this,
          I took the advice of one user who suggested that limiting the glowing
          effect inside the button could make this more readable for them. The
          final design choice is on the

        <p class= "p-space">There was also a series of minor adjustments I made
          for this app to be more inclusive, and the one that sticks out the
          most was made by an airline assistant. Because she is constantly
          traveling and has an unreliable location, distance is a tricky area
          for her because she could be at different states at different times.
          As such, I significantly increased the maximum distance so that people
          with similar professions could also use this app. The final design
          choice is on the

      <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>
          I was unfamiliar with iOS as someone who only used android my entire
          life, and I am unfamiliar with both astrology and dating apps. This
          made it a challenging project in that I was doing something with
          subjects that I do not have much prior knowledge to. I did think I was
          over in my head when I first did this, so I was surprised by how well
          this all came together, considering that I was not really sure what I
          was doing in the process of creating this prototype. This helped me
          feel more confident in my ability to tackle projects that are outside
          my comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also found that I was able to create prototypes much faster than
          before, and do a better job in directing users in the directions I
          want them to take when they are navigating through my app. I could see
          the improvements I made in designing and organizing my projects in
          comparison with the previous one I was invested in, so it was
          encouraging for me to see that I have grown somewhat as a designer.
        </p>
        <p>I also see the areas in this project where there is room for
          improvement. I stopped at the iteration where I am at right now, but I
          think being aware that there is always more that I can do with this
          project can be helpful in making better products.
