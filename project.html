      <!--02. OVERVIEW-->
      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>When this project started, I was asked to build a cloud storage program
        that allowed users to the following things:

        1) save content from the internet
        2) organize content
        3) create content or uploading files from a hard drive
        4) share items from the cloud to other people and collaborate

        There was not a lot of specific directives to follow regarding this
        process outside the objectives stated above. However, after going
        through several different iterations of the possible directions for this
        program’s brand, I decided on MemeFolder, a program that allows users to
        save image reactions and gifs from the internet and organize them into
        folders. It also allows users to edit image files so that they can
        create their own memes, as well as share them with friends.
      </p>


      <!--03. PROBLEM-->
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>I got my inspiration for this program from two places:
        1) a viral image which shows an individual struggling to find an image
        reaction due to their highly disorganized and overcrowded folder, and
        2) under viral twitter tweets, users would respond with humerous gifs,
        and other users would request for the original poster to share how they
        found that gif. The MemeFolder should allow users to address both
        problems, which appear to happen rather frequently online.

        For many Millennial users, social media is an integral part of their
        lives, and as such it becomes necessary to be knowledgeable of meme
        culture as a visual style of communication. Considering the
        proliferation of meme formats available, it can become frustrating for
        users to find and keep track of existing memes in their phones or
        desktop; it can also be equally frustrating for users who are unable to
        find the memes or gifs that they want, as there is no easy way to easily
        get these image files directly from social media sites.
      </p>


      <!--04. USER SURVEY-->
      <h2>USER SURVEY</h2>
      <p>The user survey was created before the branding was established. I
        wrote the questions assuming that I will be creating a generic cloud
        storage program. The results I got from the people who completed the
        survey went as follows:
      </p>
      <p class= "white-center">80% of users have a cloud storage
        The most common reasons why people use a cloud storage is
        1) for work/school: 85.7%
        2) personal reasons: 71.4%
        3) collaboration and file sharing: 64.3%

        When asked what features they rely on, 82.1% of users
        1) upload files to backup data
        2) upload files for easy access between devices
        3) file sharing with friends/colleagues.

        Majority of people surveyed are Millennials or Generation Z.
      </p>
      <!-- change to href later-->
      <h4>view survey questions</h4>
      <p>My intention was to create a cloud storage that addressed the
        aforementioned issues, which is evident in early prototypes. However,
        the idea for the meme editing feature came because 100% of the surveyed
        users are active participants of social media.
      </p>


      <!--05. USER PERSONA-->
      <h2>USER PERSONA</h2>
      <p>User personas were created based on the results from the survey. My
        users were profiled after the Facebook controversy and how they violated
        user privacy, which affected how they responded to the questions.

        <li>Sex: Female</li>
        <li>Occupation: Medical Interpreter</li>
        <li>Location: Yucatan, MX</li>
        <li>MOTIVATIONS:</li>
        <li>An avid nature lover, Azul first started using cloud storages so
          that she can enjoy the outdoors while doing her homework on Google Drive
          from her phone. While she is currently an infrequent user now that she
          has left her college years, Azul seems to be motivated by the
          convenience that cloud storages can give her, and the freedom of
          movement so that she can do her work wherever she wants.
        </li>
        <li>GOALS:</li>
        <li>1. Save her writing and pictures</li>
        <li>2. Share files with friends</li>
        <li>3. Backing up important personal data</li>
        <li>FRUSTRATIONS:</li>
        <li>1. Inability to trust how the companies managing cloud storages use
          people’s personal information</li>
        <li>2. Lack of ethics in large companies like Google and Facebook</li>
        <li>3. Inability to personalize/accessorize cloud storages</li>
        <li>BIOGRAPHY</li>
        <li>Azul lives with her cat in Mexico. An introvert with social anxiety,
          she is an avid user of social media, which she relies on to make
          connections with online communities. She is passionate about social
          justice and has a strong sense of ethics and morality. On her time
          off, she loves playing the ukelele and singing songs, as well as
          reading and writing.

        <li>Occupation: Student</li>
        <li>Location: Lawndale, CA</li>
        <li>MOTIVATIONS</li>
        <li>Charlene primarily uses cloud storage to do their school work as a
          college student, as well as for their part time job as a college
          student assistant. They find that using the file sharing feature to
          collaborate with their classmates makes doing work much more
          convenient. However, they express wariness regarding the information
          that companies like Google collects about their personal life, and
          would like to see tech creators be more ethical about how they create
          new products.
        </li>
        <li>GOALS: </li>
        <li>1. Using file sharing features for collaborative reasons in school
        </li>
        <li>2. Backing up personal data</li>
        <li>3. Saving old, sentimental pictures</li>
        <li>FRUSTRATIONS:</li>
        <li>1. Fear of being unable to control the data put in cloud</li>
        <li>2. Distrust towards tech industries, and how it can infringe on an
          individual’s personal liberties</li>
        <li>3. Tech being inaccessible for people who come from underprivileged
          backgrounds</li>
        <li>BIOGRAPHY</li>
        <li>Charlene lives with their mother, sister, and brother. They are fond
          of playing games on their Nintendo Switch, and likes to hang out with
          friends, read books, and knit in their spare time. They are an avid
          user of technology, and use it daily for things such as social media
          and listening to music.

      <img src="images/UserFlow.png">


      <!--08. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS-->
      <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>I chose Google Drive and Dropbox, which are two of the most popular
        cloud storage devices. I also chose to compare it with Amazon Drive,
        as it is an atypical cloud storage device that sells photo albums based
        on the pictures that users upload to this device. I wanted something
        unusual to compare with more traditional cloud storages to see how it
        would do in comparison.
      </p>
      <!-- Google Drive img -->
      <p class="c2">This is the most popular cloud storage among the users surveyed, and
        among the most user friendly. Google Drive has file editing programs and
        allows for real time collaboration between different users.
      </p>
      <!-- Dropbox img -->
      <p class="c2">Dropbox is another widely used cloud storage, and is especially popular
        for businesses. They do have problems with security, as well as with
        syncing, which results in duplicate files.
      </p>
      <!-- Amazon img -->
      <p class="c2">Amazon Drive is not as widely used, though it comes from a strong
        brand. While user interface is not as friendly, its primary purpose in
        selling photographic memorabilia could attract a niche market.

      <!--09. WIREFRAMES-->
      <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
      <p>The wireframes for the initial design were made based on a protytpe
        called MyCloud, which was the first iteration of this project.

      <!--10. WIREFRAMES-->
      <h2>BRANDING</h2>
      <p>The style guide went through three iterations as I developed the brand
        for this cloud storage device.
      </p>
      <p>The first iteration was called <span class="underline_green">MyCloud
        </span>, which was a generic device that
        allowed users to upload files and organize them in folders, as well as
        share them with friends. It offered one file editing program, which
        allowed users to edit pictures and make their own memes, in deference to
        the Millennials/Gen Z majority that took my survey. After completing the
        prototype, I realized that I should commit to this direction, and
        rebranded my program.
      </p>
      <p>This resulted in the second iteration <span class="underline_green">
        MyFolder</span>, which is a cloud
        storage specifically made to collect and organize memes, gifs, and
        reaction images, mostly for the purpose of social media. This is an
        app-only program also allows users to create their own memes and share
        it with friends.
      </p>
      <p>After making more changes to the brand, I came up with
        <span class="underline_pink">MemeFolder</span> in
        the third iteration. It has the same functionality as MyFolder, but with
        minor changes in the logo and color scheme.
      </p>


      <!--11. STYLE GUIDE-->
      <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
      <p>In this section, I’ve included the style guides for all three
        iterations of the program.
      </p>
      <p>For the <span class="underline_green">MyCloud</span>
        iteration, I created the following logo and the color
        scheme that was to go with it, as well as the chosen font:
      </p>
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MyCloud.png">
      <p>I went with blue and yellow to convey the sky to match the cloud brand,
        and included darker red and green to give the program a neutral
        appearance since I believed the aforementioned colors to be too bright.
        For the font, I went with Righteous for the rounded edges to match the
        curves in the logo.
      </p>
      <p>For the <span class="underline_green">MyFolder</span>
        iteration, I created the folowing logo and color
        scheme, as well as the chosen font:
      </p>
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MyFolder.png">
      <p>I chose more dramatic colors to catch the eyes of a younger audience,
        focusing primarily on the contrast between dark grey and pink. I also
        chose Dosis for the logo’s font, as its much narrower appearance gives
        it a sleeker and more modern look. The change in the logo, a smiley face
        superimposed on a folder, is a reflection of how users will be able to
        pull image reactions from this folder in order to convey their emotions
        on social media.
      </p>
      <p>For the <span class="underline_pink">MemeFolder</span>
        iteration, I created the following logo and color
        scheme, as well as the chosen font:
      </p>
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MemeFolder.png">
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MemeFolder2.png">
      <p>I made minor changes to the logo to make it look minimalistic without
        appearing to be childish, and added different variations of what it
        could look like under different cirumstances. There is also minor color
        changes, as I chose a marginally darker grey to provide a greater
        contrast with the pink. The fonts have remained unchanged.
      </p>


      <!--12. USER TESTING-->
      <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
      <p>In this section, I’ve included the user testing for all three
        iterations of the program.
      </p>
      <p>For the <span class="underline_green">MyCloud</span>
        iteration, I meant to create a desktop version with a
        mobile app. In the intial testing, I looked at different preferences
        users have with how the columns are positioned and whether the stars
        should be located before or after the name of the file. In the result of
        the preference test, people preferred a narrow left hand column and the
        star located before the file name.
      </p>
      <img src="images/MyCloud.png">
      <!-- change to href later -->
      <h4>view user testing result</h4>
      <p>In the <span class="underline_green">MyFolder</span> iteration, I
        changed direction to create an app only version. The program initially
        had a bar at the bottom of the screen and app settings in the side bar.
        This was, however, an inconvenient design, and after running a test I
        ended up removing both and putting the features in the side bar instead.

      <p>In the <span class="underline_pink">MemeFolder</span>
        iteration, I kept the integrity of the app, but
        changed the logo and made minor adjustments to the color scheme. Having
        recieved feedback that the logo at the time was not very aesthetically
        pleasing, I made adjustments to improve its appearance.

      <p>In conclusion, the MemeFolder app is a personalized product that is
        geared to suit individual users. This is geared towards Millennials who
        can use it to save and create memes, which is an important part of
        social media culture. It is easy to use, and offers features that is
        useful to the average user.
