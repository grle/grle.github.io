      <!--02. OVERVIEW-->
      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>When this project started, I was asked to build a cloud storage program
          that allowed users to the following things:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Save content from the internet</li>
            <li>Organize content</li>
            <li>Create content or uploading files from a hard drive</li>
            <li>Share items from the cloud to other people and collaborate</li>
          </ol>
        <p>There was not a lot of specific directives to follow regarding this
          process outside the objectives stated above. However, after going
          through several different iterations of the possible directions for this
          program’s brand, I decided on MemeFolder, a program that allows users to
          save image reactions and gifs from the internet and organize them into
          folders. It also allows users to edit image files so that they can
          create their own memes, as well as share them with friends.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!--03. PROBLEM-->
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I got my inspiration for this program from two places:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A viral image which shows an individual struggling to find an image
          reaction due to their highly disorganized and overcrowded folder, and
          </li>
          <li>Under viral twitter tweets, users would respond with humerous gifs,
          and other users would request for the original poster to share how they
          found that gif.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The MemeFolder should allow users to address both
          problems, which appear to happen rather frequently online.

          For many Millennial users, social media is an integral part of their
          lives, and as such it becomes necessary to be knowledgeable of meme
          culture as a visual style of communication. Considering the
          proliferation of meme formats available, it can become frustrating for
          users to find and keep track of existing memes in their phones or
          desktop; it can also be equally frustrating for users who are unable to
          find the memes or gifs that they want, as there is no easy way to easily
          get these image files directly from social media sites.
        </p>
      </div>


      <!--04. USER SURVEY-->
      <div class="grey-background">
        <h2>USER SURVEY</h2>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p>The user survey was created before the branding was established. I
            wrote the questions assuming that I will be creating a generic cloud
            storage program. The results I got from the people who completed the
            survey went as follows:
          </p>
          <div class="dark-background-curve">
            <p><span class="pink">80%</span> of users have a cloud storage</p>
            <p>The most common reasons why people use a cloud storage is:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>For work/school - <span class="green">85.7%</span></li>
                <li>Personal reasons - <span class="green">71.4%</span></li>
                <li>Collaboration and file sharing - <span class="green">64.3%</span>
                </li>
              </ol>
            <p>When asked what features they rely on, <span class="pink">82.1%</span>
              of users:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Upload files to backup data</li>
                <li>Upload files for easy access between devices</li>
                <li>File sharing with friends/colleagues</li>
              </ol>
          </div>

          <p>Majority of people surveyed are <span class="underline_green">
            <strong>Millennials</strong></span> or
            <span class="underline_green"><strong>Generation Z</strong></span>.

            target="_blank" class="button_pink">view survey questions</a>
          </div>
          <p>My intention was to create a cloud storage that addressed the
            aforementioned issues, which is evident in early prototypes. However,
            the idea for the meme editing feature came because
            <span class="underline_green"><strong>100% of the surveyed
            users are active participants of social media.</strong></span>

      <!--05. USER PERSONA-->
      <h2>USER PERSONA</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>User personas were created based on the results from the survey. My
          users were profiled after the Facebook controversy and how they violated
          user privacy, which affected how they responded to the questions.

            has left her college years, Azul seems to be motivated by the
            convenience that cloud storages can give her, and the freedom of

            collaborate with their classmates makes doing work much more
            convenient. However, they express wariness regarding the information
            that companies like Google collects about their personal life, and

      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I chose Google Drive and Dropbox, which are two of the most popular

          as it is an atypical cloud storage device that sells photo albums based
          on the pictures that users upload to this device. I wanted something
          unusual to compare with more traditional cloud storages to see how it
          would do in comparison.

          called MyCloud, which was the first iteration of this project.

      <!--10. WIREFRAMES-->
      <h2>BRANDING</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>The style guide went through three iterations as I developed the brand
          for this cloud storage device.
        </p>
        <p>The first iteration was called <span class="underline_green">
          <strong>MyCloud</strong></span>, which was a generic device that
          allowed users to upload files and organize them in folders, as well as
          share them with friends. It offered one file editing program, which
          allowed users to edit pictures and make their own memes, in deference to
          the Millennials/Gen Z majority that took my survey. After completing the
          prototype, I realized that I should commit to this direction, and
          rebranded my program.
        </p>
        <p>This resulted in the second iteration <span class="underline_green">
          <strong>MyFolder</strong></span>, which is a cloud
          storage specifically made to collect and organize memes, gifs, and
          reaction images, mostly for the purpose of social media. This is an
          app-only program also allows users to create their own memes and share
          it with friends.
        </p>
        <p>After making more changes to the brand, I came up with
          <span class="underline_pink"><strong>MemeFolder</strong></span> in
          the third iteration. It has the same functionality as MyFolder, but with
          minor changes in the logo and color scheme.
        </p>
      </div>


      <!--11. STYLE GUIDE-->
      <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>In this section, I’ve included the style guides for all three
          iterations of the program.
        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyCloud</strong></span>
          iteration, I created the following logo and the color
          scheme that was to go with it, as well as the chosen font:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MyCloud.png" class="large">
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I went with blue and yellow to convey the sky to match the cloud brand,
          and included darker red and green to give the program a neutral
          appearance since I believed the aforementioned colors to be too bright.
          For the font, I went with Righteous for the rounded edges to match the
          curves in the logo.
        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyFolder</strong></span>
          iteration, I created the folowing logo and color
          scheme, as well as the chosen font:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MyFolder.png" class="large">
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I chose more dramatic colors to catch the eyes of a younger audience,
          focusing primarily on the contrast between dark grey and pink. I also
          chose Dosis for the logo’s font, as its much narrower appearance gives
          it a sleeker and more modern look. The change in the logo, a smiley face
          superimposed on a folder, is a reflection of how users will be able to
          pull image reactions from this folder in order to convey their emotions
          on social media.
        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="underline_pink"><strong>MemeFolder</strong></span>
          iteration, I created the following logo and color
          scheme, as well as the chosen font:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MemeFolder.png" class="large">
      <img src="images/StyleGuide/MemeFolder2.png" class="large">
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I made minor changes to the logo to make it look minimalistic without
          appearing to be childish, and added different variations of what it
          could look like under different cirumstances. There is also minor color
          changes, as I chose a marginally darker grey to provide a greater

      <!--12. USER TESTING-->
      <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>In this section, I’ve included the user testing for all three
          iterations of the program.
        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyCloud</strong></span>
          iteration, I meant to create a desktop version with a
          mobile app. In the intial testing, I looked at different preferences
          users have with how the columns are positioned and whether the stars
          should be located before or after the name of the file. In the result of
          the preference test, people preferred a narrow left hand column and the
          star located before the file name.

        <p>In the <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyFolder</strong></span>
          iteration, I
          changed direction to create an app only version. The program initially
          had a bar at the bottom of the screen and app settings in the side bar.
          This was, however, an inconvenient design, and after running a test I
          ended up removing both and putting the features in the side bar instead.

          iteration, I kept the integrity of the app, but
          changed the logo and made minor adjustments to the color scheme. Having
          recieved feedback that the logo at the time was not very aesthetically
          pleasing, I made adjustments to improve its appearance.
