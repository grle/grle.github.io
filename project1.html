      <!--02. OVERVIEW-->
      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>When this project started, I was asked to build a cloud storage program
          that allowed users to the following things:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Save content from the internet</li>
            <li>Organize content</li>
            <li>Create content or uploading files from a hard drive</li>
            <li>Share items from the cloud to other people and collaborate</li>
          </ol>
        <p>There was not a lot of specific directives to follow regarding this
          process outside the objectives stated above. However, after going
          through several different iterations of the possible directions for this
          programâ€™s brand, I decided on MemeFolder, a program that allows users to
          save image reactions and gifs from the internet and organize them into
          folders. It also allows users to edit image files so that they can
          create their own memes, as well as share them with friends.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!--03. PROBLEM-->
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I got my inspiration for this program from two places:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A viral image which shows an individual struggling to find an image
          reaction due to their highly disorganized and overcrowded folder
          </li>
          <li>Under viral twitter tweets, users would respond with humerous gifs,
          and other users would request for the original poster to share how they
          found that gif
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The MemeFolder should allow users to address both
          problems, which appear to happen rather frequently online.

          For many Millennial users, social media is an integral part of their
          lives, and as such it becomes necessary to be knowledgeable of meme
          culture as a visual style of communication. Considering the
          proliferation of meme formats available, it can become frustrating for
          users to find and keep track of existing memes in their phones or
          desktop; it can also be equally frustrating for users who are unable to
          find the memes or gifs that they want, as there is no easy way to easily
          get these image files directly from social media sites.
        </p>
      </div>


      <!--04. USER SURVEY-->
      <div class="grey-background">
        <h2>USER SURVEY</h2>
        <div class="p-container">
          <p>The user survey was created before the branding was established. I
            wrote the questions assuming that I will be creating a generic cloud
            storage program. The results I got from the people who completed the
            survey went as follows:

          from her phone. While she is currently an infrequent user now that she
          has left her college years, Azul seems to be motivated by the
          convenience that cloud storages can give her, and the freedom of
          movement so that she can do her work wherever she wants.

          <strong>MOTIVATIONS:</strong><br>
          Charlene primarily uses cloud storage to do their school work as a
          college student, as well as for their part time job as a college
          student assistant. They find that using the file sharing feature to
          collaborate with their classmates makes doing work much more
          convenient. However, they express wariness regarding the information
          that companies like Google collects about their personal life, and
          would like to see tech creators be more ethical about how they create
          new products.

      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I chose Google Drive and Dropbox, which are two of the most popular
          cloud storage devices. I also chose to compare it with Amazon Drive,
          as it is an atypical cloud storage device that sells photo albums based
          on the pictures that users upload to this device. I wanted something
          unusual to compare with more traditional cloud storages to see how it
          would do in comparison.

      <!--10. WIREFRAMES-->
      <h2>BRANDING</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>The style guide went through three iterations as I developed the brand
          for this cloud storage device.
        </p>
        <p>The first iteration was called <span class="underline_green">
          <strong>MyCloud</strong></span>, which was a generic device that
          allowed users to upload files and organize them in folders, as well as
          share them with friends. It offered one file editing program, which
          allowed users to edit pictures and make their own memes, in deference to
          the Millennial/Gen Z majority that took my survey. After completing the
          prototype, I realized that I should commit to this direction, and
          rebranded my program.
        </p>
        <p>This resulted in the second iteration <span class="underline_green">
          <strong>MyFolder</strong></span>, which is a cloud
          storage specifically made to collect and organize memes, gifs, and
          reaction images, mostly for the purpose of social media. This is an
          app-only program also allows users to create their own memes and share
          it with friends.
        </p>
        <p>After making more changes to the brand, I came up with
          <span class="underline_pink"><strong>MemeFolder</strong></span> in
          the third iteration. It has the same functionality as MyFolder, but with
          minor changes in the logo and color scheme.
        </p>
      </div>


      <!--11. STYLE GUIDE-->
      <h2>BRAINSTORM</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>I started off with the sketch for my generic cloud storage, which
          included several logos that revolves around the cloud and sun imagery.
          I eventually settled on the one that led to the MyCloud logo, which
          represents the first iteration of this project.
        </p>
        <div class="dark-background">
          <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/LogoSketch.jpg" class="sketch">
        </div>
        <p class="p-space">I also drew a brainstorm that detailed the directions that this product
          can go to, and itâ€™s from here that I came across the idea that meme
          editing could be included in the app, which was included in the MyCloud
          prototype and eventually became the focus of the brand that was to be
          MyFolder.
        </p>
        <div class="dark-background">
          <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/Brainstorm.jpg" class="sketch">
        </div>
        <p class="p-space">From these sketches, I created the next three iterations of my
          cloud storage app. In the following section, Iâ€™ve included the style
          guides for all of them, which includes
          <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyCloud</strong></span>,
          <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyFolder</strong></span>, and finally,
          <span class="underline_pink"><strong>MemeFolder</strong></span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>For the <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyCloud</strong></span>
          iteration, I created the following logo and the color
          scheme that was to go with it, as well as the chosen font:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MyCloud.png" class="large">
      <div class="p-container">
        <p class="p-space">I went with blue and yellow to convey the sky to match the cloud brand,
          and included darker red and green to give the program a neutral
          appearance since I believed the aforementioned colors to be too bright.
          For the font, I went with Righteous for the rounded edges to match the
          curves in the logo.
        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyFolder</strong></span>
          iteration, I created the following logo and color
          scheme, as well as the chosen font:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MyFolder.png" class="large">
      <div class="p-container">
        <p class="p-space">I chose more dramatic colors to catch the eyes of a younger audience,
          focusing primarily on the contrast between dark grey and pink. I also
          chose Dosis for the logoâ€™s font, as its much narrower appearance gives
          it a sleeker and more modern look. The change in the logo, a smiley face
          superimposed on a folder, is a reflection of how users will be able to
          pull image reactions from this folder in order to convey their emotions
          on social media.
        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="underline_pink"><strong>MemeFolder</strong></span>
          iteration, I created the following logo and color
          scheme, as well as the chosen font:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MemeFolder.png" class="large">
      <img src="images/Project1/StyleGuide/MemeFolder2.png" class="large">
      <div class="p-container">
        <p class="p-space">I made minor changes to the logo to make it look minimalistic without
          appearing to be childish, and added different variations of what it
          could look like under different circumstances. There are also minor color
          changes, as I chose a marginally darker grey to provide a greater
          contrast with the pink. The fonts have remained unchanged.
        </p>
      </div>


      <!--12. USER TESTING-->
      <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>In this section, Iâ€™ve included the user testing for all three
          iterations of the program.
        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="underline_green"><strong>MyCloud</strong></span>
          iteration, I meant to create a desktop version with a
          mobile app. In the inital testing, I looked at different preferences
          users have with:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Column width</li>
            <li>Whether the stars should be located before or after the file name</li>
            <li>Width of the password recovery email request</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Based on the result of the preference test, people preferred:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A narrow left hand column</li>
            <li>The star located before the file name</li>
            <li>A narrow password recovery email request</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I used the following three slides in the preference test. The
          <span class="underline_green"><strong>images on the right</strong></span>
          were the ones favored by people who participated in the test, and were
          ultimately included in the final version of the first prototype.

          iteration, I
          changed direction to create an app only version. The program initially
          had a bar at the bottom of the screen and app settings in the side bar.
          This was, however, an inconvenient design, and after running a test I
          ended up removing both and putting the features in the side bar instead.

      <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
      <div class="p-container">
        <p>
          Working on this project taught me that the process of developing a brand
          requires several iterations in order to focus on a particular direction.
          I realized after finishing this project that the initial direction that
          you want the project to go to may not be where it ends up, and that I
          needed to be flexible when I noticed that I can make changes that could
          improve the program itself, whether it is to sharpen its image or make
          its purpose more cohesive for users.</p><p>It also required tenacity, in that
          I had to be willing to redo the work that I had done in order to reflect
          the change in direction; I was initially resistant to this because I
          wanted to avoid doing more work that would be needed when I changed my
          brand direction, but embracing this has allowed me to make a stronger
          product. And even now, looking at MemeFolder, I am still thinking of
          ways I can improve the logo or enhance the prototype and include new
          features that users may want. </p><p>I have desisted for now, simply because
          there are other projects that I would like to spend my energy on, but
          working on this app has taught me that there can always be improvements
          and iterations that can make this project better for my users.
