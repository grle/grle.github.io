        <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve been interested in design. I started drawing
          at a very young age and took as many art related extracurriculars as
          I could. I kept my love for design on the peripherals, however,
          because I didn't realize I could utilize this skillset professionally until
          I learned about UX design. </p>

        <p>I started being interested in learning more about tech when I came to
          college as a freshman in the engineering program and took a computer
          science class. While I later switched out to get my degree in Linguistics
          and Comparative Literature, I graduated with a minor in computer science,
          and took classes looking into how technology can affect how we look into
          learning. Before I graduated, I took a class in Digital Humanities, which
          let me see the possibilities of how using tech to design learning systems
          can help students and teachers alike in the classroom. This inspired me to
          get a master’s degree in Learning Science Technology, where I further
          learned about the ways in which we can incorporate tech to improve
          classroom curriculum. </p>

        <p>Being a UX designer allows me to combine the interests I have in
          technology and the humanities, and my hope is that I can use my background
          in education to influence how tech could be used to create intuitive
          programs. Beyond my training in graduate school, I have hands on
          experience using tech in educational places, whether it be in museums or
          the classroom. </p>

        <p>My experience as an educator and time as a master’s student has also
          taught me to think of people left behind as technology advances. I worked
          as a teacher for students with mental health problems that prevent them
          from succeeding in traditional schooling environments, and think a lot
          about how it’s important to make learning inclusive for them. When I went
          to graduate school, I also learned about how tech can negatively impact
          low income students who may not be able to afford basic technology others
          take for granted, which has the effect of leaving them behind and widening
          the digital divide. As a UX designer, I hope that I can incorporate my
          social consciousness into my designs and create something that can be
          accessible for everyone.</p>

        <p>I find inspiration from the totality of my experience and interest into
          my work, and hope that I can only grow as a designer from here.
