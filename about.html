      <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve been interested in design. I started drawing
        at a very young age and displayed artistic capabilities that I was proud
        of, back when I felt that I never had any other distinguishing
        capabilities. I kept my love for design on the peripherals, however,
        because I never felt I could use it for anything productive in my everyday
        life until I learned about UX design. </p>

      <p>I started being interested in learning more about tech when I came to
        college as a freshman in the engineering program and took a computer
        science class. While I later switched out to get my degree in Linguistics
        and Comparative Literature, I graduated with a minor in computer science,
        and took classes looking into how technology can affect how we look into
        learning. Before I graduated, I took a class in Digital Humanities, which
        let me see the possibilities of how using tech to design learning systems
        can help students and teachers alike in the classroom. This inspired me to
        get a master’s degree in Learning Science Technology, where I further
        learned about the ways in which we can incorporate tech to improve
        classroom curriculum. </p>

      <p>Being a UX designer allows me to combine the interests I have in
        technology and the humanities, and my hope is that I can use my background
        in education to influence how tech could be used to create intuitive
        programs. Beyond my training in graduate school, I have hands on
        experience using tech in educational places, whether it be in museums or
        the classroom. </p>

      <p>My experience as an educator and time as a master’s student has also
        taught me to think of people left behind as technology advances. I worked
        as a teacher for students with mental health problems that prevent them
        from succeeding in traditional schooling environments, and think a lot
        about how it’s important to make learning inclusive for them. When I went
        to graduate school, I also learned about how tech can negatively impact
        low income students who may not be able to afford basic technology others
        take for granted, which has the effect of leaving them behind and widening
        the digital divide. As a UX designer, I hope that I can incorporate my
        social consciousness into my designs and create something that can be
        accessible for everyone.</p>

      <p>I find inspiration from the totality of my experience and interest into
        my work, and hope that I can only grow as a designer from here.
